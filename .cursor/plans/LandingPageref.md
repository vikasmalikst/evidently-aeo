THE PAIN WE'RE SOLVING

The Core Problem:
Search has shifted from ten blue links to one AI-generated answer. Answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Copilot) are intercepting 15-45% of clicks that used to go to organic search.

📊 Talking Points:
Publishers and brands seeing 20-40% drops in search clicks
People are ChatGpt-ing more than Googling before any purchase. AI answer engines now act as "source of truth" in many categories
Most brands have zero visibility into how they appear in these systems
Traditional SEO metrics look "fine" while traffic quietly erodes


2. WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE MARKET

SEO denial: Teams still clinging to old SEO playbooks while AI answers eat their lunch
Traffic decay: Visible drops in search traffic despite stable rankings in legacy tools
Answer engines rising: AI answer engines becoming default discovery method
No visibility: Brand managers don't know how they show up across answer engines
No levers: Lack of systematic way to change answer engine presence - no playbook, no workflow
ROI unclear: Hard to translate answer visibility to attributable revenue/CAC/LTV
Competitor tools ignored: Existing dashboards focus on vanity metrics, nobody logs in

💬 Talking Points:
"Even CMOs who care about digital don't know where to start with AEO"
"Teams ask: How do I know if I'm winning or losing in AI search?"
"The gap between awareness and action is massive"


IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (ICP)

Company Profile:
Significant existing investment in SEO, content, and brand
Material dependence on organic discovery (search, social, marketplaces)
Mid-market to large B2C/B2B brands in education, comparison, and trust-driven categories
Finance, health, SaaS, consumer tech, travel, CPG


Buyer & Champion Roles:
• CMO / VP Marketing / Head of Brand - Owns narrative and category positioning
• VP / Director Growth or Digital - Accountable for pipeline and acquisition efficiency
• Head of Content / SEO / Organic - Wants new framework for AEO with clear levers
• Marketing / Data / Strategy leads - Want new leading indicators and business outcome ties

"Right Now" Triggers:
Noticeable declines in organic traffic while content/SEO spend is flat or increasing
Board/C-suite asking: "What's our AI strategy?" and "How do we show up in AI search?"
Frustration with unused SEO tools that generate reports but don't change outcomes

💬 Talking Points:
• "Our ICP is someone who's already invested in being found, now needs to be the answer"
• "They have budget and resources, but no clear roadmap for AEO"
• "The trigger is pain + executive pressure + existing spend justification"






1. The Pain We’re Solving
Search has shifted from ten blue links to one AI-generated answer, and answer engines are already capturing a growing share of discovery and click-through that used to belong to organic search.​
Brands are seeing meaningful drops in search-driven traffic as AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other answer engines keep users on-platform and compress choice into a single recommended answer.​
What this feels like for brand leaders:
Traditional SEO metrics can still look “okay” while organic traffic and high-intent discovery quietly erode.​
AI answer engines increasingly act as the “source of truth,” but most brands have no visibility into how they show up or how to influence that presence.​

2. What We Hear From the Market
From industry experts and operators, the same story keeps coming up:
Head in the sand: Many teams are still clinging to classic SEO, hoping the old playbook will work in an answer-first world.
Traffic decay: Brand and digital managers are already noticing drops in search traffic even when rankings appear stable in legacy tools.​
Answer engines rising: AI answer engines are emerging as a primary discovery surface, and AEO is becoming a recognized discipline rather than a fringe idea.​
No idea how they’re doing: Brand managers don’t know their visibility, share of answer, or sentiment across answer engines.
No levers to pull: Even when they sense issues, they lack a structured way to change answer engine visibility and influence.​
ROI is murky: Teams struggle to connect AI answer visibility to revenue, CAC, and LTV, despite early evidence that answer-led experiences drive trust and higher-intent engagement.​
Competitor tools are unused: Existing tools are dashboards that nobody logs into; they don’t drive programs, behavior change, or ownership.​

What are we Building
Evidently is the only full-loop Answer Engine Optimization system that starts with measurement and ends with accountable outcomes.​
Measurement: Visibility, share of answer, sentiment across all answer engines; new leading indicators (citation depth)
Analytics: Diagnose where brand is invisible, misrepresented, or underperforming by topic, and channel
Actions & Recommendations: Prioritized plays—
content to create/update, 
publishers to influence, 
authority gaps to close
Execution Strategy: 
Structured playbooks for marketing,
 content, PR, product teams tailored to answer engines
Content Generation: 
AI-assisted workflows for answer-ready assets (Q&A, structured data, FAQs, expert POVs) aligned to answer engine requirements
Impact Measurement: 
Re-measure visibility, answer share, sentiment, downstream metrics (traffic, conversions, revenue) to prove ROI and refine loop
✅ "Business Model" - Now 3 concise bullets:
Outcome as a Service, not SaaS: Engagements anchored on outcomes ("own answers for 3-5 strategic themes in 6-12 months"), not seat licenses; system + guidance moves visibility, authority, revenue
Not a KPI/Dashboard company: Dashboards serve decisions, workflows, accountability; addresses competitor failure mode (unused reports, no engagement)
White-glove services: Strategy facilitation, narrative design, program management, cross-functional alignment, hands-on content/activation support

3. ICP: Who We Are For
Evidently is built for organizations that need to own the answer in AI systems, not just rank on a page.
Company profile
Mid-market to large B2C and B2B brands in categories where education, comparison, and trust matter (finance, health, SaaS, consumer tech, travel, CPG, etc.).​
Significant existing investment in SEO, content, and brand—meaning the shift to answer engines directly affects revenue and market perception.​
Material dependence on organic discovery (search, social, marketplaces) as a growth and efficiency lever.​
Buyer and champion roles
CMO / VP Marketing / Head of Brand
Owns the narrative and category positioning; cares about how the brand is “remembered” by AI systems and consumers.​
VP / Director of Growth or Digital
Accountable for pipeline and acquisition efficiency; needs to explain declining SEO performance and unlock new demand from answer engines.​
Head of Content / SEO / Organic
Knows the current SEO playbook is aging out; wants a new, concrete framework for Answer Engine Optimization with clear levers and feedback loops.​
Marketing / Data / Strategy leads
Want new leading indicators (answer share of voice, AI citations, sentiment) and a way to tie them to business outcomes.​
“Right now” triggers
Noticeable declines in organic traffic or branded search while spend on content/SEO is flat or increasing.​
Board or C-suite questions about “our AI strategy” and “how we show up in AI search.”​
Frustration with unused SEO/visibility tools that generate reports but don’t change outcomes.​

4. Why Evidently Is Different
Most solutions stop at visibility reports. Evidently is the only full-loop Answer Engine Optimization system that starts with measurement and runs all the way through to measurable business outcomes.​
The Full Loop:
• Measurement: Visibility, share of answer, sentiment across all answer engines; new leading indicators (citation depth, context)
• Analytics: Diagnose where brand is invisible, misrepresented, or underperforming by topic, intent, product, audience, channel
• Actions & Recommendations: Prioritized plays—content to create/update, entities/schema to fix, publishers to influence, authority gaps to close
• Execution Strategy: Structured playbooks for marketing, content, PR, product teams tailored to answer engines, not SERPs
• Content Generation: AI-assisted workflows for answer-ready assets (Q&A, structured data, FAQs, expert POVs) aligned to answer engine requirements
• Impact Measurement: Re-measure visibility, answer share, sentiment, downstream metrics (traffic, conversions, revenue) to prove ROI and refine loop

5. Business Model: Outcome as a Service
Evidently is not selling seats to a dashboard. It is selling outcomes.
• Outcome as a Service, not SaaS: Engagements anchored on outcomes ("own answers for 3-5 strategic themes in 6-12 months"), not seat licenses; system + guidance moves visibility, authority, revenue
• Not a KPI/Dashboard company: Dashboards serve decisions, workflows, accountability; addresses competitor failure mode (unused reports, no engagement)
• White-glove services: Strategy facilitation, narrative design, program management, cross-functional alignment, hands-on content/activation support
