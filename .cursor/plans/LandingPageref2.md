EvidentlyAEO is positioned as an AEO visibility and benchmarking platform that doesn’t stop at showing KPIs, but turns those metrics into an ongoing, outcome-focused program for brands.
​

Refined core positioning
Positioning statement: EvidentlyAEO is the Answer Engine Optimization intelligence and execution platform that helps brands understand and grow their Visibility, Share of Answers, and Sentiment across LLMs over time and versus competitors—then operationalizes the insights into actions and measurable business outcomes.
​

Target customer: marketing, growth, and SEO/AEO teams that need to move beyond basic AI visibility tracking and turn AEO into a managed, outcome-driven channel.
​

Differentiators vs typical AEO tools
Most AEO and AI visibility tools focus on monitoring brand mentions, citations, and sentiment across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and AI Overviews, often with dashboards and basic recommendations. EvidentlyAEO can be framed as the next step up:
​

From tracking to orchestrating outcomes: competitors primarily track visibility and offer recommendations; EvidentlyAEO bakes in workflows from Discovery → Action plan → Refinement → Impact to ensure changes actually ship.
​

From SaaS to Outcome-as-a-Service: while others sell subscriptions and dashboards, you explicitly tie success to improved share of answers, visibility, and sentiment, supported by optional professional services.
​

From static to goal-adaptive benchmarking: most tools benchmark across engines and time; you emphasize that benchmarks, tracked prompts, and competitors adapt as campaigns, launches, and market players change.
​

Messaging pillars you already hinted at
You already have strong raw ideas that can be sharpened into three messaging pillars:

360° AEO visibility intelligence

Track where and how often your brand appears in AI-generated answers across major engines, including share of answers and sentiment by topic, prompt cluster, and competitor.
​

Benchmark your AEO “footprint” over time so you can see the impact of campaigns, launches, and competitor moves.
​

Integrated action workflows, not static dashboards

Opinionated workflows guide teams from opportunity detection to prioritized actions: content to create, entities to strengthen, pages to restructure, and prompts to target.
​

Built-in content generation and task management help teams actually execute recommendations and keep a tight loop between insights and implementation.
​

Outcome-as-a-Service partnership

Optional services layer (AEO strategy, content, implementation) so customers can outsource the heavy lifting while keeping full visibility in the product.
​

Compensation and success defined around AEO outcomes—visibility lift, share-of-answers gains, and sentiment improvement—rather than logins or seat count.
​

Suggested copy directions (you can reuse)
“From AI rank tracking to AI outcomes: EvidentlyAEO turns AEO KPIs into a managed, outcome-focused channel that compounds over time.”
​

“Most AEO tools tell you what is happening in AI answers. EvidentlyAEO tells you what to do next, helps you do it, and shows exactly how it moved your visibility, share of answers, and sentiment.”
​

“As your campaigns, products, and competitors change, EvidentlyAEO keeps your benchmarks, tracked prompts, and priorities in sync—so your brand stays visible in the AI answers that matter.”
​

If you share your target segments and price point, the positioning can be narrowed further (for example: “the AEO operating system for B2B SaaS brands” vs “for multi-brand retailers”).
