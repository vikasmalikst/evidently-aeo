# Landing Page Content Revamp Plan
## Based on Reference Files: LandingPageref.md & LandingPageref2.md

**Date:** Created for content alignment with strategic positioning  
**Objective:** Transform feature-focused content into outcome-focused messaging that emphasizes the "Full Loop" system and "Outcome as a Service" model

---

## Executive Summary

The reference files position EvidentlyAEO as:
- **Answer Engine Optimization intelligence and execution platform** (not just visibility tracking)
- **Full-loop system** that goes from measurement to measurable business outcomes
- **Outcome-as-a-Service** model (not SaaS/seat-based)
- **Target audience:** Marketing, growth, SEO/AEO teams needing to move beyond basic AI visibility tracking

**Current state:** Landing page is feature-focused, dashboard-centric, and lacks the "Full Loop" narrative and outcome-focused positioning.

**Target state:** Outcome-focused messaging that emphasizes the complete system from measurement to execution to ROI, with clear differentiation from typical AEO tools.

---

## Key Strategic Insights from Reference Files

### 1. Core Positioning Statement (from LandingPageref2.md)
> "EvidentlyAEO is the Answer Engine Optimization intelligence and execution platform that helps brands understand and grow their Visibility, Share of Answers, and Sentiment across LLMs over time and versus competitors—then operationalizes the insights into actions and measurable business outcomes."

**Key elements:**
- Intelligence + Execution (not just intelligence)
- "Operationalizes insights into actions" (emphasis on execution)
- "Measurable business outcomes" (ROI focus)

### 2. The Full Loop Concept (from LandingPageref.md)
The complete system should be presented as:
1. **Measurement:** Visibility, share of answer, sentiment across all answer engines
2. **Analytics:** Diagnose where brand is invisible, misrepresented, or underperforming
3. **Actions & Recommendations:** Prioritized plays (content, entities, publishers, authority gaps)
4. **Execution Strategy:** Structured playbooks for marketing, content, PR, product teams
5. **Content Generation:** AI-assisted workflows for answer-ready assets
6. **Impact Measurement:** Re-measure and prove ROI, refine loop

**Current gap:** "How It Works" section only covers basic setup (Connect, Monitor, Optimize, Prove), not the full loop.

### 3. Three Messaging Pillars (from LandingPageref2.md)

#### Pillar 1: 360° AEO Visibility Intelligence
- Track where and how often brand appears in AI-generated answers
- Share of answers and sentiment by topic, prompt cluster, competitor
- Benchmark AEO "footprint" over time to see impact of campaigns/launches

#### Pillar 2: Integrated Action Workflows (NOT Static Dashboards)
- Opinionated workflows guide teams from opportunity detection to prioritized actions
- Built-in content generation and task management
- Tight loop between insights and implementation
- Key differentiator: "Dashboards serve decisions, workflows, accountability" (not just reports)

#### Pillar 3: Outcome-as-a-Service Partnership
- Optional services layer (AEO strategy, content, implementation)
- Success defined around AEO outcomes (visibility lift, share-of-answers gains, sentiment improvement)
- Not seat-based or login-based pricing

### 4. Key Differentiators vs Typical AEO Tools

**From Tracking to Orchestrating Outcomes:**
- Competitors track visibility and offer recommendations
- EvidentlyAEO bakes in workflows: Discovery → Action plan → Refinement → Impact
- Ensures changes actually ship

**From SaaS to Outcome-as-a-Service:**
- Others sell subscriptions and dashboards
- EvidentlyAEO ties success to improved share of answers, visibility, sentiment
- Supported by optional professional services

**From Static to Goal-Adaptive Benchmarking:**
- Most tools benchmark across engines and time
- EvidentlyAEO emphasizes benchmarks, tracked prompts, and competitors adapt as campaigns, launches, and market players change

## Content Gap Analysis

### Current Landing Page Structure
1. **Hero Section** ✅ Good foundation, but needs stronger outcome focus
2. **Problem Strip** ✅ Aligned with reference pain points
3. **Competitive Intelligence** ✅ Strong
4. **Smart Recommendations** ✅ Strong
5. **Feature Grid** ⚠️ Feature-focused, needs outcome framing
6. **How It Works** ❌ Missing Full Loop narrative
7. **Pricing** ❌ Missing Outcome-as-a-Service messaging
8. **FAQ** ⚠️ Good, but could emphasize outcomes more
9. **CTA Strip** ✅ Good

### Critical Content Gaps

#### Gap 1: Missing "Full Loop" Narrative
**Current:** "How It Works" = Connect → Monitor → Optimize → Prove (basic setup)  
**Needed:** Full Loop = Measurement → Analytics → Actions → Execution Strategy → Content Generation → Impact Measurement

**Impact:** Missing the core differentiator - the complete system that goes beyond tracking.

#### Gap 2: Missing "Outcome-as-a-Service" Positioning
**Current:** Pricing shows tiers with features  
**Needed:** Emphasize outcomes (e.g., "Own answers for 3-5 strategic themes in 6-12 months"), optional services, success tied to outcomes not seats

**Impact:** Positioning as SaaS instead of Outcome-as-a-Service.

#### Gap 3: Missing "Content Generation" & "Execution Strategy"
**Current:** Features mention recommendations but don't highlight content generation workflows or execution playbooks  
**Needed:** Explicit sections on AI-assisted content generation and structured playbooks for teams

**Impact:** Missing key differentiators from the Full Loop.

#### Gap 4: Dashboard vs Workflow Positioning
**Current:** Implies dashboard/product focus  
**Needed:** Emphasize "integrated workflows" and "not a dashboard company" - dashboards serve decisions/workflows, not just reports

**Impact:** Positioning as another dashboard tool instead of an execution platform.

#### Gap 5: Missing White-Glove Services Emphasis
**Current:** No mention of professional services  
**Needed:** Highlight optional services layer (strategy, content, implementation support)

**Impact:** Missing Outcome-as-a-Service differentiator.

## Detailed Content Revamp Strategy

### Section 1: Hero Section
**Current headline:** "Win in AI Search Before Your Competitors Even Know They're Losing"

**Recommended updates:**
- Keep current headline (strong and aligned)
- **Update subheadline** to emphasize intelligence + execution:
  - Current: "Track your brand's visibility across ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overview, Grok and Bing Copilot. Get data-driven recommendations that actually work. Prove ROI to your CFO."
  - **New:** "The Answer Engine Optimization intelligence and execution platform. Measure visibility, operationalize insights into actions, and prove measurable business outcomes—not just dashboards."

**Rationale:** Emphasizes the platform nature (intelligence + execution) and outcome focus.

---

### Section 2: Problem Strip
**Current:** ✅ Well-aligned with reference pain points  
**Minor updates:**
- Emphasize "most brands have zero visibility" (from reference)
- Add mention of "traditional SEO metrics look fine while traffic erodes"

**Recommended content:**
- Problem 1: Keep current ✅
- Problem 2: Keep current ✅  
- Problem 3: Strengthen to emphasize ROI connection

---

### Section 3: Competitive Intelligence (Hero Feature 1)
**Current:** ✅ Strong and aligned  
**Minor updates:**
- Add emphasis on "goal-adaptive benchmarking" - benchmarks adapt as campaigns/launches change
- Mention "vs. competitors over time" more prominently

---

### Section 4: Smart Recommendations (Hero Feature 2)
**Current:** ✅ Strong foundation  
**Recommended updates:**
- **Add emphasis on "Content Generation"** - mention AI-assisted workflows for answer-ready assets
- **Add mention of "Execution Strategy"** - structured playbooks for teams
- Strengthen connection to "not generic SEO advice" - emphasize answer-engine-specific

**New bullet points to consider:**
- "AI-assisted content generation—workflows for creating answer-ready assets (Q&A, structured data, FAQs, expert POVs)"
- "Execution playbooks—structured guidance for marketing, content, PR, and product teams tailored to answer engines"

---

### Section 5: Feature Grid
**Current:** 6 features (Share of Answer, Sentiment, Query Mapping, Historical Trends, AI-Specific Recommendations, Competitive Benchmarking)

**Recommended updates:**
- **Reframe feature descriptions** to emphasize outcomes, not just capabilities
- **Add "Content Generation" feature** (or integrate into Smart Recommendations section)
- **Add "Execution Strategy/Playbooks" feature** (or integrate into Smart Recommendations section)
- **Reframe as "The Full Loop"** or add a section explaining the Full Loop before features

**New feature ideas:**
- **Content Generation & Workflows:** AI-assisted workflows for creating answer-ready assets, integrated task management, tight loop between insights and implementation
- **Execution Playbooks:** Structured playbooks for marketing, content, PR, product teams tailored to answer engines

**Reframing example:**
- Current: "Share of Answer Tracking - Know if you're gaining or losing ground..."
- **Reframed:** "Share of Answer Tracking - Track your competitive position and prove visibility gains that drive business outcomes..."

---

### Section 6: How It Works
**Current:** 4 steps (Connect, Monitor, Optimize, Prove)

**Recommended complete revamp:**
**Replace with "The Full Loop" section showing 6 stages:**

1. **Measure** - Visibility, share of answer, sentiment across all answer engines
2. **Analyze** - Diagnose where brand is invisible, misrepresented, or underperforming
3. **Act** - Get prioritized recommendations (content, entities, publishers, authority gaps)
4. **Execute** - Use structured playbooks and AI-assisted content generation
5. **Prove** - Re-measure visibility, answer share, sentiment, and downstream metrics
6. **Refine** - Close the loop with continuous optimization

**Visual:** Could use a circular/loop visualization instead of linear steps

**Alternative approach:** Keep current "How It Works" but add a new "The Full Loop" section before or after it.

---

### Section 7: New Section - "Why EvidentlyAEO Is Different"
**Current:** Not present

**Recommended addition:**
Create a new section highlighting three key differentiators:

   - Ensures changes actually ship

2. **From SaaS to Outcome-as-a-Service**
   - Others sell subscriptions and dashboards
   - EvidentlyAEO ties success to outcomes (visibility lift, share-of-answers gains, sentiment improvement)
   - Optional professional services layer

3. **From Static to Goal-Adaptive Benchmarking**
   - Most tools benchmark across engines and time
   - EvidentlyAEO adapts benchmarks, tracked prompts, and competitors as campaigns, launches, and market players change

**Placement:** After Feature Grid, before How It Works (or replace current How It Works positioning)
