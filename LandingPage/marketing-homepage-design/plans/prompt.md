SUPER PROMPT: Full Marketing Website Revamp (Senior-Level)

Context
You are a Senior Frontend Engineer, Senior Marketing Analyst, and Product Designer working on a production-grade SaaS marketing website.

I have already created a basic marketing website using Bolt, but the UI is too basic, the UX is not engaging, and the content is generic and not product-specific. It does not clearly communicate value, differentiation, or credibility.

I have pasted the entire project folder here for reference. The main landing page component exists in the project and should be treated as the current implementation baseline.

Objective
Your goal is to transform this project into a high-converting, modern SaaS marketing website with strong product storytelling, polished UI and UX, smooth animations and micro-interactions, a clear value proposition, trust-building sections, and a conversion-focused layout.

The final result should be comparable in quality to top-tier SaaS websites such as Stripe, Linear, Vercel, or Notion, while maintaining the existing theme and brand identity.

Phase 1: Deep Analysis (Mandatory)
Before proposing or writing any code, thoroughly analyze the existing codebase.

Review the component structure, layout hierarchy, styling approach, responsiveness, reusability, performance, and accessibility. Identify clear gaps in UI consistency, UX flow, messaging clarity, product differentiation, and conversion paths such as CTAs and funnels.

This must be treated as a real product and marketing audit, not a superficial redesign.

Phase 2: Dedicated Planning (Strict Requirement)
Before implementing any changes, create a complete, structured, step-by-step plan inside a new folder named plans.

The plan must include the following sections.

Information Architecture
Define the final section order for the website, including hero, problem, solution, features, social proof, pricing, FAQ, and final call to action. Clearly explain the reasoning behind the placement of each section and how it supports user flow and conversion.

UI and UX Revamp Plan
Detail layout improvements, spacing and visual hierarchy changes, typography scale, color usage, mobile-first design decisions, and accessibility improvements such as contrast, focus states, and keyboard navigation.

Animation and Interaction Plan
Define how animations and transitions will be used, including hero entrance animations, scroll-based reveals, hover micro-interactions, button feedback, and section transitions. Ensure animations are smooth, purposeful, and performance-safe.

Component Strategy
Identify which parts of the site should be converted into reusable components, which sections require custom components, and where component abstraction improves maintainability. Clearly justify each decision.

UI Libraries and Tools
Explicitly evaluate and justify the use of modern UI libraries such as shadcn, animation libraries such as Framer Motion, icon systems, and any lightweight utilities that improve UX. Avoid over-engineering and ensure the final result remains clean, premium, and fast.

Phase 3: Marketing and Content Strategy (Critical)
Assume the role of a Senior Marketing Analyst.

Analyze the product deeply to understand the core problem it solves, the target audience, key pain points, and competitive differentiation.

Replace all generic copy with product-specific messaging that emphasizes benefits over features. Use outcome-driven language that is clear, confident, modern, and credible.

Create content for the hero headline and subheadline, problem statement, core value proposition, feature breakdowns with real-world usage, how-it-works section, competitive advantage section, and multiple call-to-action sections.

Phase 4: FAQ Section (Mandatory)
Create a well-structured FAQ section that addresses common customer objections, pricing concerns, trust and security, onboarding complexity, integrations, scalability, and clarity around who the product is and is not for.

The FAQ content should reduce friction, build confidence, and improve conversion.

Phase 5: Visual and UX Polish
Ensure the site creates a strong first impression within the first few seconds. Establish a clear visual flow that guides the user naturally through the page. Use multiple calls to action without clutter. Ensure smooth scrolling, subtle effects, and an overall premium experience.

This is not just a UI refresh. It is a conversion-optimized marketing experience.

Rules
Do not write or modify code immediately.
Do not skip the planning phase.
The first output must be the complete plan inside the plans folder.
Only after the plan is approved should implementation begin.
Maintain the existing theme while significantly elevating quality.
Think like a product owner, not just a developer.

Final Goal
The final website should explain the product clearly within 30 seconds, look modern and trustworthy, feel smooth and interactive, and effectively convert visitors into users.

Treat this as a real startup website preparing to go live for customers.
