| **0:00** | **[Face to Camera / Intro]**<br>Speaker stands in a modern office.<br><br>*Text Overlay:* **The Crisis: Invisible Traffic Drain** | **(Speaker):** "Traditional SEO is dying a quiet death. Your customers aren't just Googling anymore—they’re asking ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. And when these AIs answer, they don't send traffic to your website. They answer *for* you." |
| **0:15** | **[Screen Share - The Problem]**<br>Split screen: Flat Google Analytics vs. ChatGPT answering a user query without citing the brand. | **(Speaker):** "We call this the **Invisible Traffic Drain**. Traditional tools like Semrush are blind to this. They can't tell you if ChatGPT is recommending you... or your competitor." |
| **0:30** | **[Logo Animation]**<br>EvidentlyAEO Logo appears.<br>*Text Overlay:* **The 3-Step AEO Platform: Measure • Analyze • Optimize** | **(Speaker):** "Enter **EvidentlyAEO**. We are the world's first full-loop Answer Engine Optimization platform. We solve this crisis in three powerful steps: **Measure, Analyze, and Optimize**." |
| **0:45** | **[Demo: Measure - KPIs & Segmentation]**<br>User hovers over **Visibility**, **Brand Presence**, and **Sentiment** cards.<br>Then toggles **"Biased"** vs **"Blind"** filter.<br>Graph updates to show different scores. | **(Speaker):** "First, **Measure**. We track three core KPIs: **Visibility** (our proprietary score for prominence), **Brand Presence** (% of mentions), and **Sentiment** (tone). We then segment these by **Biased Queries** (brand-specific) versus **Blind Queries** (generic), so you know if you're winning on reputation or true market discoverability." |
| **1:10** | **[Demo: Analyze - Citation Sources]**<br>User clicks **"Citation Sources"** tab.<br>Shows a heatmap: "Reddit (High Impact)", "TechCrunch (Low Impact)". | **(Speaker):** "Second, **Analyze**. Our **Citation Source Intelligence** tells you exactly which channels are feeding the AI's answers. We show you what’s working and where you need to **pivot your content strategy** to get cited." |
| **1:25** | **[Demo: Analyze - Queries & Answers]**<br>User clicks **"Queries & Answers"**. Shows a list of specific questions (e.g., "Best CRM"). Columns show **My Brand** vs. **Competitor**. <br>One row has a low score and a **Red Triangle Icon** next to it. | **(Speaker):** "But you need granular details. In the **Queries & Answers** view, you review performance line-by-line. Compare your answers directly against competitors. See that **Red Triangle**? That flags a performance gap—a critical opportunity waiting to be claimed." |
| **1:45** | **[Demo: Optimize - Smart Recommendations]**<br>User **clicks the Red Triangle**. It instantly opens a **"Recommendation Card"**: *Action: Create Comparison Article. Impact: High.* | **(Speaker):** "Clicking the flag takes you straight to **Optimize**. Our **Smart Recommendations Engine** turns that gap into a plan. It gives you a prioritized checklist of exactly what content you need to win that specific query." |
| **2:00** | **[Demo: Content Studio - Templates]**<br>User clicks **"Generate Content"**.<br>Modal opens with templates: *YouTube Short Script*, *White Paper Structure*, *Reddit Post*.<br>User selects **"Industry Article"**. | **(Speaker):** "And we help you build it. With our **Content Studio**, you get standardized, high-performance templates for any format—from white papers to Reddit posts. You don't start from scratch; you start with a winning structure." |
| **2:15** | **[Demo: Content Studio - Gen & Edit]**<br>Platform generates the article.<br>User highlights a section, clicks **"Regenerate with professional tone"**, then types a custom edit. | **(Speaker):** "The AI generates a draft instantly. Need a different tone? Regenerate it. Want to add your unique insight? Edit directly in the platform. It’s a seamless workflow from insight to published content." |
| **2:35** | **[Demo: ROI & Outcomes]**<br>User navigates to **"ROI & Impact"** view.<br>Shows "Before/After" chart with 'Share of Answer' trending up. | **(Speaker):** "This is the full loop. You **Measure** the invisible, **Analyze** the root cause, and **Optimize** for the win. We prove the ROI of every action you take." |
| **2:50** | **[Face to Camera / Outro]**<br>Speaker returns.<br><br>*Text Overlay:* **EvidentlyAEO: Measure. Analyze. Optimize.** | **(Speaker):** "The search landscape has shifted. Brands can either be invisible, or they can be the answer. EvidentlyAEO ensures you are the answer." |
