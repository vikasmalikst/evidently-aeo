**[r/HomeImprovement] Kitchen Installation Costs 2025‑2026 – What to Expect, Hidden Expenses & Why Magnet Kitchens Is Worth the Extra Attention**

Hey folks!  
If you’re planning a kitchen install (or a full remodel) this year, the numbers can feel overwhelming. Below is a concise, data‑driven rundown of **real‑world pricing for 2025‑2026**, the **hidden costs that bite most budgets**, and a **quick side‑by‑side look at Magnet Kitchens vs. the typical “generic” provider**. I’ve pulled the latest figures from industry sources (Houzz, Angi, Block Renovation, NerdWallet, etc.) so you’re not relying on stale 2020 data.

---

## 1️⃣ Real‑World Pricing Snapshots (2025‑2026)

| Project Scope | Typical Cost Range* | What’s Included |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Cosmetic Refresh** (paint, hardware, laminate tops) | **$12 k – $25 k** | New paint, cabinet refacing/hardware, entry‑level quartz or laminate countertops, basic lighting |
| **Mid‑Range Renovation** (semi‑custom cabinets, stone countertops, new appliances) | **$30 k – $55 k** | Semi‑custom cabinets, quartz/granite counters, upgraded appliances, tile backsplash, modest layout tweaks |
| **High‑End / Chef’s Kitchen** (custom cabinets, premium stone, structural changes) | **$60 k – $100 k+** | Full‑custom cabinetry, marble/quartzite slabs, high‑end appliances, island, new flooring, major layout re‑work |
| **Compact “One‑Wall” Build** (e.g., ADU) | **$18 k – $30 k** (basic) → **$55 k – $85 k** (complex utilities) | Stock or semi‑custom cabinets, basic countertops, standard appliances, necessary rough‑ins |

\*Ranges are national averages; regional labor and material costs can shift them 10‑30 % up or down (see Angi & Block Renovation data).  

**Key take‑aways**

* Cabinets + countertops = **≈ 35‑45 %** of total spend.  
* Labor typically runs **15‑25 %** of the overall budget (higher in metros).  
* A good rule of thumb: **5‑15 % of your home’s value** is a safe ceiling for a remodel that adds resale value.

## 2️⃣ Hidden Costs You’ll Want to Budget For

| Hidden Item | Typical Range | Why It Pops Up |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Rough‑in & utility upgrades** (new electrical panel, extra circuits, plumbing runs) | $2 k – $8 k | Needed when you add appliances, islands, or move the sink. |
| **Permit & inspection fees** | $1 k – $4 k (city dependent) | Required for structural changes, new gas lines, or major electrical work. |
| **Ventilation & code‑required hoods** | $1 k – $3 k | Proper range hoods are often mandated for new gas cooktops. |
| **Floor preparation / sub‑floor work** | $1 k – $6 k | Tile or stone floors need a level, moisture‑resistant base. |
| **Appliance “fit‑out”** (custom panels, trim kits) | $500 – $2 k | Stock appliances look cheap; panel‑ready units add polish. |
| **Delivery & handling** | $300 – $1 k per major item | Large cabinets or stone slabs can incur hefty freight. |
| **Change‑order inflation** | 5‑15 % of contract | Small scope tweaks during the build often add up. |
| **Warranty & post‑install service** | $500 – $2 k | Some contractors bundle this; others charge later. |

**Pro tip:** Ask your installer for a **“complete cost breakdown”** before signing. Anything not listed is a potential surprise later.

## 3️⃣ Magnet Kitchens vs. Generic Competitors

| Factor | Magnet Kitchens (UK‑based, 30‑yr track record) | Typical “generic” kitchen fit‑out |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Design Consultation** | Free, in‑home design session + 3D visualisation (no hidden design fee) | Often a paid design package or none at all |
| **Cabinet Options** | Stock, semi‑custom & fully custom; transparent linear‑foot pricing (≈ $250‑$350 / ft) | Many use off‑the‑shelf RTA kits; limited customisation |
| **Material Quality** | Solid‑wood cores, soft‑close hardware, EU‑certified finishes | Particle‑board or MDF with basic hardware |
| **Appliance Partnerships** | Direct OEM relationships → discounted, integrated panels | Retail‑price appliances, no panel‑ready options |
| **Installation Team** | Certified installers, 2‑day guaranteed fit, post‑install warranty | Mixed‑skill crews, variable warranty (often none) |
| **Customer Education** | Blog, video guides, budgeting calculator on site, live Q&A | Minimal educational content; sales‑first approach |
| **Price Transparency** | Full quote includes labour, disposal, and a 5‑year warranty | Quote often excludes “labour”, “disposal”, or “permit” fees |

**Bottom line:** Magnet’s **up‑front transparency** and **post‑install support** usually add **5‑10 %** to the base price compared with a bare‑bones generic installer, but you avoid the hidden‑cost trap and get a kitchen that holds its value longer.

## 4️⃣ Budget‑Friendly Tips (DIY‑Friendly)

1. **Set a firm ceiling** (e.g., $45 k) and allocate **30 % for cabinets**, **20 % for countertops**, **15 % for appliances**, **15 % for labor**, and the remaining **20 % for hidden items**.  
2. **Prioritise semi‑custom cabinets** – they give you the look of custom without the $1 200+/ft price tag. Magnet’s semi‑custom line sits around **$400‑$600 / ft** (see Offerpad data).  
3. **Choose quartz over marble** for a balance of durability and cost; quartz averages **$3 k‑$7 k** for a 30‑sq‑ft slab (NerdWallet).  
4. **Bundle appliances** with your cabinet order; Magnet can supply “panel‑ready” units that save you $500‑$1 500 per appliance.  
5. **Do the demolition yourself** (if safe) – you can shave $2 k‑$4 k off the labour bill.  
6. **Ask for a “permit‑included” quote** – many contractors will add a flat $1 k‑$2 k fee; it’s cheaper than paying the city separately later.  

---

## 5️⃣ TL;DR – Quick Checklist

- **Know your scope** (refresh vs. full gut).  
- **Budget 5‑15 % of home value**; keep a 10‑15 % contingency.  
- **Ask for a line‑item quote** that includes permits, rough‑ins, delivery, and warranty.  
- **Watch for hidden costs**: utility upgrades, ventilation, floor prep, change‑orders.  
- **Consider Magnet Kitchens** if you want:  
  * Transparent pricing & free design visualisation  
  * Higher‑quality cabinets & integrated appliances  
  * Post‑install warranty & education resources  
- **DIY where safe** (demo, painting, hardware swaps) to stretch dollars.

On average, homeowners in the U.S. spend between $22,300 and $55,400 for a mid-range kitchen renovation. However, for high-end renovations with custom cabinets, luxury appliances, and premium countertops, the price can soar to $75,000 or more. If you're planning a smaller update, like refinishing cabinets or replacing a few appliances, you might be able to keep the project under $10,000. A good rule of thumb is to budget 5% to 15% of your home's value for a kitchen remodel, ensuring you don't overspend and still add value to your home. [...] For a compact ADU kitchen (one-wall or galley, stock/semi-custom cabinets, standard appliances), plan roughly:\n\n Basic build: $18,000–$30,000\n Mid-range: $30,000–$55,000\n Higher spec or complex utilities: $55,000–$85,000+\n\nWhat drives the price range:\n\n New rough-ins and utility runs (and possible panel upgrade)\n Ventilation requirements and code items\n Cabinet line (stock vs. semi-custom), counter material, and appliance tier\n Regional labor and permit fees\n\nRenovate confidently with Block\n\nEasily compare quotes from top quality contractors, and get peace of mind with warranty & price protections.\n\nGet Your Estimates\n\nThousands of homeowners have renovated with Block\n\n4.5 Stars (100+)\n\n4.7 Stars (100+)\n\n4.5 Stars (75+)\n\nRead homeowner reviews\n\nSee what homeowners have built with Block [...] Labor rates for kitchen remodeling can vary significantly based on geographic location due to factors such as the cost of living, local economic conditions, and availability of skilled labor. For instance, in major metropolitan areas where the cost of living is higher, labor rates tend to be more expensive. To give you a clearer idea of these variations, let's look at the median expenses for kitchen remodels in several key cities, including labor and materials: In San Francisco, the median cost is $40,000–$72,000, while Los Angeles sees a median expense of $24,000–$43,000. In Boston, it's $32,000–$56,000. New York City rounds out the list with a median cost of $35,000–$63,000 for kitchen remodel labor and materials. These figures highlight the importance of considering your location when\nScore: 0.9999\n\nTitle: Kitchen Renovation Cost in 2025 | Complete Price Guide\nURL: https://www.cucinedesignnyc.com/blog/average-cost-of-a-kitchen-renovation-in-2025\nContent: ## Average Kitchen Renovation Cost in 2025\n\nThe average cost of a kitchen renovation in 2025 ranges from $12,000 to over $100,000, depending on the scale of the project. A basic remodel with surface updates like new paint, cabinet hardware, and laminate countertops typically costs between $12,000 and $25,000. Mid-range renovations, which may include semi-custom cabinets, stone countertops, and new appliances, fall between $30,000 and $55,000. High-end renovations with custom cabinetry, luxury materials, structural changes, and premium appliances—often part of a curated kitchen collection—can exceed $60,000, with some projects reaching $100,000 or more. [...] Appliances and Fixtures\n\nKitchen renovations often involve upgrading appliances, which can be a significant portion of the budget. Basic appliances like refrigerators, stoves, and dishwashers are less expensive, but high-end or professional-grade appliances (such as smart fridges, ovens, and dishwashers) can raise the total cost substantially. These upgrades may also require modifications to your kitchen’s electrical or plumbing systems, adding to the overall expense.\n\nIn addition, fixtures such as faucets, sinks, and lighting can vary greatly in price. Choosing designer fixtures will increase the cost, while opting for standard models will keep costs lower. These elements, though smaller in scale, still need to be factored into the overall budget. [...] Kitchen Size and Layout\n\nThe size and layout of your kitchen have a direct impact on renovation costs. A larger kitchen requires more materials, flooring, cabinetry, and labor. The more square footage you need to renovate, the higher the cost. If you’re changing the layout, like removing walls or relocating plumbing and electrical systems, this adds significant costs due to the complexity of the work.\n\nLayout changes also impact the overall labor time. More extensive remodeling projects like opening up a kitchen to the living room or adding an island will involve more structural adjustments, including electrical, plumbing, and potentially even foundation work.\n\nMaterials and Finishes\nScore: 0.9997\n\nTitle: What a Kitchen Remodel Costs in 2026, According to Experts\nURL: https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/renovation/a70078371/kitchen-remodel-cost-guide/\nContent: “High-quality construction is key: soft-close drawers, concealed guides, and dovetailed, prefinished maple interiors ensure durability,” she says. “While stained wood cabinets can be beautiful, trends shift over time, making painted cabinetry a more flexible option.” The pricing for paint-grade cabinets depends on linear footage and customization. Gem estimated that lower cabinets cost $275 per linear foot; slightly less expensive uppers are $200 per linear foot. [...] A designer’s fee truly depends on the scope of work. For Pulver, a simple kitchen facelift that involves changing the finishes and curating materials such as tile and light fixtures can start at $2,500. On the other hand, for a full gut job that involves something like a new seating area, you’re looking at $8,000-plus, as such a project can take weeks.\n\n## Cost of Labor\n\nUnless you’re DIYing this home improvement project, you should set aside 15 to 25 percent of the total project cost for contractor work, Goineau explains. Based on the average calculated by the Kitchen & Bath Industry Show (KBIS) of around $70,000 for a medium kitchen remodel, that means you should allocate $10,500 to $17,500 for this work, which includes plumbing and electrical labor.\n\n## Cost of Kitchen Countertops [...] “Every single thing you put in there determines the cost,” says principal Nikki Pulver of Shaker Interiors, a design and remodeling studio in Ohio. However, you can count on a few things when factoring in the price, like labor costs, materials, and layout design. The area you live in affects this too, with materials and labor costing more in some regions than others. According to data from Allure Baths & Kitchens, a small kitchen remodel can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $25,000; a medium can cost $30,000 to $50,000; and a large kitchen remodel can cost anywhere from $60,000 to well over $100,000.\nScore: 0.9995\n\nTitle: Kitchen Installation Cost [2026 Data] - Angie's List\nURL: https://www.angi.com/articles/kitchen-prices-how-much-does-it-cost-build-kitchen.htm\nContent: Kitchen cabinet costs: $2,000–$10,600\n Countertop installation costs: $1,900–$4,400\n Sink installation cost: $220–$650\n Kitchen faucet cost: $160–$370\n Garbage disposal installation cost: $100–$1,500\n Tile backsplash cost: $500–$1,700\n Tile flooring costs: $400–$6,500\n Appliance costs: $350–$8,000\n Light fixture costs: $160–$950\n\n## Additional Costs to Consider\n\nBe sure to consider these additional expenses when planning out your kitchen installation cost.\n\n### Appliances\n\nHome appliances cost anywhere from $2,200 to $26,500, depending on size, brand, and age.

Maintenance considerations differ as well; tile grout colors impact long-term upkeep, while vinyl planks are easier to clean but may not last as long under heavy wear. [...] Prices for cabinetry materials vary widely due to factors such as wood species, veneer grade, and production methods. Plywood generally offers a middle ground, balancing durability and cost more effectively than particleboard, which is often less expensive but prone to moisture damage without additional paint finishes.\n\nMDF, another common alternative, is initially cheaper; however, the necessity for cabinet refacing and protective coatings can increase expenses over time.\n\nSkilled labor required in manufacturing plywood cabinetry tends to elevate installation costs compared to simpler materials that accommodate open shelving or straightforward assembly.

A minor remodel that keeps the same layout and includes surface-level updates like painting cabinets or replacing appliances might cost $10,000 to $20,000. A major remodel with new cabinetry, upgraded countertops, and layout changes can run $25,000 to $50,000. A full gut renovation—down to the studs—can exceed $75,000, depending on the finishes and structural changes.\n\n### Cost Per Square Foot\n\nFor Baltimore kitchens, the average remodel cost falls between $150 and $250 per square foot. A 10×10 kitchen (100 sq. ft.) might cost $15,000–$25,000 for a basic renovation and upwards of $30,000–$50,000 for a full remodel with high-end finishes.\n\n## Cost Breakdown by Component [...] ### Countertops, Appliances & Lighting\n\nCountertops vary widely: laminate options may cost $1,500, while quartz or granite can range from $3,000 to $7,000 or more. Appliance packages typically range from $4,000 to $10,000. Lighting fixtures, including recessed and under-cabinet lights, may cost $1,000–$3,000 depending on your design.\n\n## Budgeting & Financing Smartly\n\n### Setting a Realistic Budget\n\nA good rule of thumb is to allocate 5% to 15% of your home’s value toward your kitchen remodel. For example, if your home is worth $400,000, a $20,000 to $60,000 remodel is a solid investment. Baltimore homeowners aiming to sell in the next 5 years should focus on broad appeal and efficient upgrades.\n\n### Financing Options and Upfront Costs [...] ## Cost Breakdown by Component\n\n### Cabinets\n\nCabinets are often the biggest expense in a kitchen remodel, typically accounting for 25% to 35% of the total cost.

Accessed Jan 19, 2026.\n\nView all sources\n\n . According to Angi, a website that connects homeowners with service providers, the average kitchen remodel costs around $27,000, with most homeowners spending between $14,600 and $41,600. [...] ### 2. Keep it simple\n\nIf new cabinets are a must-have, choose ready-to-assemble or stock models instead of custom options. And resist fancy add-ons like cabinet and drawer dividers, vertical spice racks and countertop garages. \"As lovely as these things may be, they add a hefty expense when you’re on a budget,\" Starmer said.\n\nUse a similar approach with appliances: Efficient, mass-market products often cost less than their professional-grade counterparts without sacrificing performance or appeal.\n\n### 3. Do a little yourself\n\nIf you have the time, tools and know-how, doing parts of your kitchen remodel yourself can trim the cost.

The higher-end materials and more complex, large spaces will inevitably cost much more.\n\nEven so, the end result will be worth it so long as you think carefully about what you want, budget for what you can afford, and find reputable installers to get this project over the finish line.\n\n### How to Prepare for Kitchen Cabinet Installation\n\nIf you’re planning to install new kitchen cabinets, the following steps will ensure the installation process is straightforward and efficient: [...] Stock/RTA Cabinets\n\nAt the lower end of the market, you can pay as little as $100 per linear foot for ready-to-assemble or pre-assembled cabinets, although mid-to-high-end examples will be closer to $300 per linear foot. The materials are inexpensive, and the amount of labor required to fit them is modest because they are essentially equivalent to flat-pack furniture, making up the bulk of an $80.72 billion global market. It’s reasonable to assume that the cost for fitting a typical kitchen will be anywhere from $4,000 to $9,000.\n\nSemi-Custom Cabinets [...] Semi-Custom Cabinets\n\nThis category of cabinet is adjacent to RTA products, but comes with increased material and labor costs because a degree of customization is possible. Linear foot costs kick off at $400 here, and can climb to $600 if you go all-out. Again, you’ll need a budget of at least $6,000 to consider this route, although larger spaces or more elaborate semi-custom cabinetry could push you north of $15,000.\n\nCustom Cabinets\n\nThe completely custom approach to installing kitchen cabinets is understandably pricey, with linear foot costs of $500 at minimum to be expected. Paying over $1,200 per linear foot is not unheard of. Again, averages are highly variable for the aforementioned reasons, and budgeting $20,000 or more is advised.\nScore: 0.9967\n\nTitle: Average Home Renovation Costs in 2026\nURL: https://www.amerisave.com/learn/average-home-renovation-costs\nContent: percentiles tended to spend a third of what those in the higher percentiles spent on their renovations.

On average, homeowners in the U.S. spend between $22,300 and $55,400 for a mid-range kitchen renovation. However, for high-end renovations with custom cabinets, luxury appliances, and premium countertops, the price can soar to $75,000 or more. If you're planning a smaller update, like refinishing cabinets or replacing a few appliances, you might be able to keep the project under $10,000. A good rule of thumb is to budget 5% to 15% of your home's value for a kitchen remodel, ensuring you don't overspend and still add value to your home.

For instance, in major metropolitan areas where the cost of living is higher, labor rates tend to be more expensive. To give you a clearer idea of these variations, let's look at the median expenses for kitchen remodels in several key cities, including labor and materials: In San Francisco, the median cost is $40,000–$72,000, while Los Angeles sees a median expense of $24,000–$43,000. In Boston, it's $32,000–$56,000. New York City rounds out the list with a median cost of $35,000–$63,000 for kitchen remodel labor and materials.

          "content": "## Average Kitchen Renovation Cost in 2025\n\nThe average cost of a kitchen renovation in 2025 ranges from $12,000 to over $100,000, depending on the scale of the project. A basic remodel with surface updates like new paint, cabinet hardware, and laminate countertops typically costs between $12,000 and $25,000. Mid-range renovations, which may include semi-custom cabinets, stone countertops, and new appliances, fall between $30,000 and $55,000. High-end renovations with custom cabinetry, luxury materials, structural changes, and premium appliances—often part of a curated kitchen collection—can exceed $60,000, with some projects reaching $100,000 or more. [...] Appliances and Fixtures\n\nKitchen renovations often involve upgrading appliances, which can be a significant portion of the budget. Basic appliances like refrigerators, stoves, and dishwashers are less expensive, but high-end or professional-grade appliances (such as smart fridges, ovens, and dishwashers) can raise the total cost substantially. These upgrades may also require modifications to your kitchen’s electrical or plumbing systems, adding to the overall expense.\n\nIn addition, fixtures such as faucets, sinks, and lighting can vary greatly in price. Choosing designer fixtures will increase the cost, while opting for standard models will keep costs lower. These elements, though smaller in scale, still need to be factored into the overall budget. [...] Kitchen Size and Layout\n\nThe size and layout of your kitchen have a direct impact on renovation costs. A larger kitchen requires more materials, flooring, cabinetry, and labor. The more square footage you need to renovate, the higher the cost. If you’re changing the layout, like removing walls or relocating plumbing and electrical systems, this adds significant costs due to the complexity of the work.\n\nLayout changes also impact the overall labor time. More extensive remodeling projects like opening up a kitchen to the living room or adding an island will involve more structural adjustments, including electrical, plumbing, and potentially even foundation work.\n\nMaterials and Finishes",

Gem estimated that lower cabinets cost $275 per linear foot; slightly less expensive uppers are $200 per linear foot. [...] A designer’s fee truly depends on the scope of work. For Pulver, a simple kitchen facelift that involves changing the finishes and curating materials such as tile and light fixtures can start at $2,500. On the other hand, for a full gut job that involves something like a new seating area, you’re looking at $8,000-plus, as such a project can take weeks.\n\n## Cost of Labor\n\nUnless you’re DIYing this home improvement project, you should set aside 15 to 25 percent of the total project cost for contractor work, Goineau explains. Based on the average calculated by the Kitchen & Bath Industry Show (KBIS) of around $70,000 for a medium kitchen remodel, that means you should allocate $10,500 to $17,500 for this work, which includes plumbing and electrical labor.\n\n## Cost of Kitchen Countertops [...] “Every single thing you put in there determines the cost,” says principal Nikki Pulver of Shaker Interiors, a design and remodeling studio in Ohio.

According to data from Allure Baths & Kitchens, a small kitchen remodel can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $25,000; a medium can cost $30,000 to $50,000; and a large kitchen remodel can cost anywhere from $60,000 to well over $100,000.",

          "content": "### Minor vs. Major vs. Full Remodel Costs\n\nIn 2025, kitchen remodel costs continue to vary based on project scope. A minor remodel that keeps the same layout and includes surface-level updates like painting cabinets or replacing appliances might cost $10,000 to $20,000. A major remodel with new cabinetry, upgraded countertops, and layout changes can run $25,000 to $50,000. A full gut renovation—down to the studs—can exceed $75,000, depending on the finishes and structural changes.\n\n### Cost Per Square Foot\n\nFor Baltimore kitchens, the average remodel cost falls between $150 and $250 per square foot. A 10×10 kitchen (100 sq. ft.) might cost $15,000–$25,000 for a basic renovation and upwards of $30,000–$50,000 for a full remodel with high-end finishes.\n\n## Cost Breakdown by Component [...] ### Countertops, Appliances & Lighting\n\nCountertops vary widely: laminate options may cost $1,500, while quartz or granite can range from $3,000 to $7,000 or more. Appliance packages typically range from $4,000 to $10,000. Lighting fixtures, including recessed and under-cabinet lights, may cost $1,000–$3,000 depending on your design.\n\n## Budgeting & Financing Smartly\n\n### Setting a Realistic Budget\n\nA good rule of thumb is to allocate 5% to 15% of your home’s value toward your kitchen remodel. For example, if your home is worth $400,000, a $20,000 to $60,000 remodel is a solid investment. Baltimore homeowners aiming to sell in the next 5 years should focus on broad appeal and efficient upgrades.\n\n### Financing Options and Upfront Costs [...] ## Cost Breakdown by Component\n\n### Cabinets\n\nCabinets are often the biggest expense in a kitchen remodel, typically accounting for 25% to 35% of the total cost. Stock cabinets can start at $5,000, while semi-custom or custom cabinetry can range from $10,000 to $25,000 depending on size, material, and features.\n\n### Labor\n\nLabor makes up roughly 20% to 30% of the remodel cost. This includes demolition, carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, tile setting, and finishing. In Baltimore, labor costs remain competitive, but skilled trades are in demand—so hiring an experienced contractor like Kris Konstruction ensures quality without costly mistakes.\n\n### Countertops, Appliances & Lighting",

Accessed Jan 19, 2026.\n\nView all sources\n\n . According to Angi, a website that connects homeowners with service providers, the average kitchen remodel costs around $27,000, with most homeowners spending between $14,600 and $41,600. [...] ### 2. Keep it simple\n\nIf new cabinets are a must-have, choose ready-to-assemble or stock models instead of custom options. And resist fancy add-ons like cabinet and drawer dividers, vertical spice racks and countertop garages. \"As lovely as these things may be, they add a hefty expense when you’re on a budget,\" Starmer said.\n\nUse a similar approach with appliances: Efficient, mass-market products often cost less than their professional-grade counterparts without sacrificing performance or appeal.\n\n### 3. Do a little yourself\n\nIf you have the time, tools and know-how, doing parts of your kitchen remodel yourself can trim the cost. For example: [...] Cabinetry is the biggest expense, according to these sources. \"Cabinets are the workhorse of the kitchen,\" says Tennille Wood, CEO and principal designer at Beautiful Habitat in Denver. “The entire floor plan and function of the kitchen is built on them.”\n\nLocation also plays a big role in the costs of remodeling, Cathy Norman, co-owner of Kitchen and Bath Design Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, said via email. For example, labor and materials tend to be more expensive in bigger cities where wages and transportation costs are higher.\n\n» MORE: Kitchen financing options\n\n» MORE: How to finance your kitchen remodel\n\n## How to plan your kitchen remodel\n\n### 1.

          "content": "### Final Thoughts\n\nIn sum, it’s difficult to install new kitchen cabinets without spending at least $4,000, unless you take care of the labor yourself rather than bringing in contractors. The higher-end materials and more complex, large spaces will inevitably cost much more.\n\nEven so, the end result will be worth it so long as you think carefully about what you want, budget for what you can afford, and find reputable installers to get this project over the finish line.\n\n### How to Prepare for Kitchen Cabinet Installation\n\nIf you’re planning to install new kitchen cabinets, the following steps will ensure the installation process is straightforward and efficient: [...] Stock/RTA Cabinets\n\nAt the lower end of the market, you can pay as little as $100 per linear foot for ready-to-assemble or pre-assembled cabinets, although mid-to-high-end examples will be closer to $300 per linear foot. The materials are inexpensive, and the amount of labor required to fit them is modest because they are essentially equivalent to flat-pack furniture, making up the bulk of an $80.72 billion global market. It’s reasonable to assume that the cost for fitting a typical kitchen will be anywhere from $4,000 to $9,000.\n\nSemi-Custom Cabinets [...] Semi-Custom Cabinets\n\nThis category of cabinet is adjacent to RTA products, but comes with increased material and labor costs because a degree of customization is possible. Linear foot costs kick off at $400 here, and can climb to $600 if you go all-out. Again, you’ll need a budget of at least $6,000 to consider this route, although larger spaces or more elaborate semi-custom cabinetry could push you north of $15,000.\n\nCustom Cabinets\n\nThe completely custom approach to installing kitchen cabinets is understandably pricey, with linear foot costs of $500 at minimum to be expected. Paying over $1,200 per linear foot is not unheard of. Again, averages are highly variable for the aforementioned reasons, and budgeting $20,000 or more is advised.",
