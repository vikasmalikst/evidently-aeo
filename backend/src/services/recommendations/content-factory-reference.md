# AEO Content Characteristics – Non-Article Content Types
Version: 1.0  
Owner: Product / AEO  
Scope: Whitepapers, Short Videos  
Purpose: Define what *high AI-scrapability content* looks like per format

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **content characteristics** required for
maximum **AI scrapability and reuse** for non-article content types.

These characteristics:
- Guide content creation
- Inform AEO scoring logic
- Act as quality benchmarks
- Are format-specific by design

This is **not** a scoring or implementation document.

---

## 2. Core AEO Principle (Applies to All Formats)

> **AI systems reuse clarity, structure, and explanation — not polish or promotion.**

Good AEO content:
- Is easy to summarize
- Is easy to quote
- Is explicit, not implied
- Explains “why”, not just “what”

---

# CONTENT TYPE: WHITEPAPERS

---

## 3. Whitepapers – AEO-Ready Content Characteristics

### 3.1 Nature of Whitepapers (AEO Context)

Whitepapers are:
- Long-form
- Authoritative
- Evidence-driven
- Trust-building assets

For AI systems, whitepapers are used as:
- Reference sources
- Background context
- Credibility anchors

AEO for whitepapers focuses on **trust and depth**, not speed.

---

## 3.2 Structural Characteristics (Must Have)

A highly AEO-scrapable whitepaper must include:

- A clear **executive summary** at the beginning
- Explicit **problem statement**
- Logical section hierarchy
- Clear transitions between sections
- Consistent terminology throughout

AI systems rely heavily on predictable structure in long documents.

---

## 3.3 Concept & Definition Clarity

Whitepapers must:

- Explicitly define all key concepts and frameworks
- Introduce definitions *before* analysis or claims
- Avoid assuming prior knowledge
- Use consistent naming for models, methods, and ideas

Undefined concepts reduce AI trust and reuse.

---

## 3.4 Evidence & Methodology Transparency

High AEO whitepapers:

- Clearly explain **how conclusions were reached**
- Describe methodology, assumptions, and scope
- Separate data from interpretation
- Reference data sources when applicable

AI systems prefer content that explains *how knowledge was produced*.

---

## 3.5 Explanation Depth (Why Over What)

Whitepapers should:

- Explain causal relationships
- Describe mechanisms and processes
- Avoid unsupported claims
- Explicitly link evidence to conclusions

Statements without reasoning reduce AI extractability.

---

## 3.6 Limitations & Assumptions (Critical for AEO)

Strong AEO whitepapers:

- Explicitly state limitations
- Acknowledge assumptions
- Clarify what the paper does *not* cover

AI systems strongly favor content that admits constraints.

---

## 3.7 Tone & Language Discipline

Whitepapers with high AI scrapability:

- Use neutral, academic, or explanatory tone
- Avoid marketing language or CTAs
- Avoid persuasive framing
- Prefer declarative, factual sentences

Reference content ≠ sales collateral.

---

## 3.8 Summary Signals for AI Reuse

Ideal AEO signals in whitepapers:

- Executive summary usable as a standalone answer
- Section summaries or conclusions
- Clear takeaway statements
- Explicit framing of “what this paper establishes”

---

# CONTENT TYPE: SHORT VIDEOS (YouTube Shorts, Reels, TikTok)

---

## 4. Short Videos – AEO-Ready Content Characteristics

### 4.1 Nature of Short Videos (AEO Context)

Short videos are:
- Extremely constrained
- Single-idea focused
- High clarity, low depth

AI systems do NOT consume visuals.
They rely on:
- Captions
- Transcripts
- Titles
- Descriptions

For AEO, **textual clarity matters more than visuals**.

---

## 4.2 Single-Idea Discipline (Non-Negotiable)

An AEO-ready short video must:

- Communicate **one idea only**
- Avoid multi-topic compression
- Have a clear beginning and conclusion

If a short video needs context to understand, it fails AEO.

---

## 4.3 Explicit Statement Requirement

High AEO short videos:

- State the claim or answer explicitly
- Avoid implied or visual-only messaging
- Do not rely on hooks alone

Example:
- ❌ “This changes everything”
- ✅ “This reduces latency by removing X step”

AI systems need explicit language.

---

## 4.4 Caption & Transcript Quality (Critical)

Short videos must have:

- Accurate captions or transcript
- Clear sentence boundaries
- Minimal filler words
- No slang that obscures meaning

Captions are the **primary AI input**, not audio.

---

## 4.5 Context Completeness

AEO-ready shorts:

- Provide enough context in text to be understood alone
- Do not depend on previous videos
- Avoid inside jokes or references

AI must be able to quote the content without extra explanation.

---

## 4.6 Quotability & Reusability

Strong AEO short videos:

- Contain at least one quotable statement
- Use declarative language
- Avoid rhetorical questions without answers

AI systems prefer content they can lift verbatim.

---

## 4.7 Tone & Language Discipline

For maximum AI reuse:

- Avoid hype and exaggeration
- Avoid CTAs
- Avoid emotional manipulation
- Prefer calm, factual delivery

Short ≠ promotional.

---

## 4.8 What Short Videos Should NOT Try to Do

AEO-unfriendly patterns:

- Overloading multiple insights
- Teaching complex workflows
- Relying on visual demonstrations alone
- Ending with “link in bio” or sales CTAs

Short videos are for **clarity**, not depth.

---

## 5. Key Difference Summary

| Aspect | Whitepapers | Short Videos |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Primary AEO Value | Trust & Depth | Clarity & Quotability |
| AI Input | Full text | Captions & transcript |
| Ideal Use | Reference source | Atomic answer |
| Depth | High | Very low |
| Speed | Slow | Immediate |

---

## 6. Relationship to AEO Scoring

These characteristics:
- Define what “good” content looks like
- Inform future AEO scoring logic
- Should guide content creation *before* scoring

Scoring systems should **measure alignment with these traits**, not redefine them.

---

## 7. Scope Control

This document covers:
- Whitepapers
- Short videos only

Other content types (podcasts, long-form video, community responses)
must have their own characteristic definitions.
