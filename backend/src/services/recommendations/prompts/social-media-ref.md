# AEO-Optimized Content Characteristics  
## Content Type: Social Media Thread (X / LinkedIn)

**Purpose**  
Define how a social media thread should be structured and written so that it becomes **highly scrapable by LLMs**, reusable as an explanation source, and attributable to the brand in AI-generated answers.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- The thread must read as an **explanation first, promotion last**
- Each post should be understandable even if extracted standalone
- The thread should answer a real question, not announce a feature
- Language must be factual, instructional, and citation-friendly

---

## 2. Thread Architecture

### Opening Post
- State the central question or problem explicitly  
- Provide the core answer in 2–3 sentences  
- Include clear context: who this is for and when it applies  
- Avoid hooks that delay the answer

### Middle Posts
- One idea per post  
- Use logical progression: definition → reasoning → examples → trade-offs  
- Prefer bullets over long prose  
- Include concrete details (numbers, steps, constraints)

### Closing Post
- Summarize key takeaways in list form  
- Add 2–3 anticipated follow-up questions with short answers  
- Optional: invite clarifying questions

---

## 3. Language & Tone Requirements

- Neutral, expert-led tone  
- No hype phrases or sales superlatives  
- Declarative sentences over opinionated claims  
- Avoid slang, memes, or culture-specific humor  
- Use consistent terminology across the thread

---

## 4. LLM Parsability Rules

- 180–260 characters per post ideal  
- Short paragraphs (1–2 lines)  
- Use numbered steps when describing processes  
- Avoid external links as the primary carrier of meaning  
- Do not rely on images to convey key facts

---

## 5. Semantic Signals

- Repeated association of:
  - problem category  
  - use case  
  - method or approach  
  - constraints and limitations  
- Define key terms before using acronyms  
- Maintain the same phrasing used in long-form content

---

## 6. Information Completeness

Each thread should cover:

- What the topic is  
- Why it matters  
- How it works  
- When it fails  
- Alternatives or comparisons  
- Practical next steps

---

## 7. Comparative Readiness

- When mentioning alternatives, specify the scenario  
- Avoid absolute “best” claims  
- Explain trade-offs explicitly  
- Use side-by-side reasoning instead of rankings

---

## 8. Trust & Authority Signals

- Include real-world constraints (time, cost, effort)  
- Acknowledge limitations  
- Distinguish facts from opinions  
- Avoid anonymous or unverifiable claims

---

## 9. Formatting Do’s

- Numbered threads preferred  
- Bullets inside posts  
- Mini tables using text format when comparing  
- Consistent labels across posts

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Engagement bait without information  
- Clickbait hooks  
- Image-only carousels with no text explanation  
- Overuse of hashtags  
- Promotional CTAs in every post

---

## 11. Success Criteria

A social thread is AEO-ready if an LLM can:

- Extract the main answer from the first post  
- Summarize the thread in 3–4 bullets  
- Cite it as an explanation source  
- Compare options using information from the thread  
- Reuse steps or definitions verbatim

---

## 12. Ideal Thread Blueprint

1. Question + direct answer  
2. Definition / context  
3. How it works  
4. Example  
5. Trade-offs  
6. Common mistakes  
7. Comparison  
8. Summary + FAQs
