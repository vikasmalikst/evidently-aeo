# Superprompt: Research Alternative LLM SERP APIs to Replace BrightData

## Your Task

You are a technical research assistant specializing in web scraping APIs, SERP (Search Engine Results Page) APIs, and LLM (Large Language Model) data collection services. I need you to research and recommend alternative API providers that can replace BrightData for collecting responses from AI-powered search engines and LLMs.

## Project Context: AI Visibility Analytics Platform

### What We Build

We operate an **AI Visibility Analytics Platform** that helps brands understand their presence and performance across major AI-powered search engines and language models. Our platform tracks:

- **Brand Visibility**: How often brands are mentioned in AI responses
- **Citation Analysis**: Which sources AI models cite when discussing brands
- **Share of Search**: Market share across different AI providers (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Bing Copilot, Grok, Perplexity, etc.)
- **Competitive Intelligence**: How brands compare against competitors in AI responses
- **Topic Analysis**: What topics and keywords drive brand mentions
- **Trend Tracking**: Changes in visibility over time

### Why We Need LLM SERP APIs

Our platform needs to **programmatically query AI models** with brand-related prompts and collect:

1. **Response Text**: The actual answer/content generated by the AI
2. **Citations/Sources**: URLs and domains that the AI references
3. **Metadata**: Model version, timestamp, query details
4. **Structured Data**: Parsed citations, extracted URLs, response quality metrics

We query multiple AI models simultaneously (concurrently) with the same prompts to compare responses across providers. This requires:

- **Reliable synchronous responses** (preferred) or fast async completion
- **High success rates** (minimal failures)
- **Fast response times** (under 30 seconds ideally, max 2 minutes)
- **Consistent data structure** across different AI providers
- **Scalability** to handle hundreds of queries per day

## Current Solution: BrightData

### What We Use BrightData For

We currently use BrightData's dataset scraping API to collect responses from:

1. **Bing Copilot** (Microsoft's AI-powered search)
2. **Grok** (X/Twitter's AI assistant)
3. **Gemini** (Google's AI model)

### Current Implementation Details

- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/scrape`
- **Method**: POST requests with dataset-specific IDs
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (API key)
- **Response Format**: JSON with answer text, citations, and metadata

### Critical Issues We're Facing

#### 1. **Synchronous Request Failures**
- BrightData's synchronous requests frequently fail (high failure rate)
- When a sync request fails, we must fall back to asynchronous polling
- This creates unpredictable latency and poor user experience

#### 2. **Excessive Polling Time**
- When falling back to async mode, BrightData returns a `snapshot_id`
- We must poll the snapshot endpoint repeatedly: `GET /datasets/v3/snapshot/{snapshot_id}`
- **Current polling configuration**:
  - Maximum attempts: **60 attempts**
  - Poll interval: **10 seconds**
  - Maximum wait time: **10 minutes** (600 seconds)
- This is unacceptable for our UX requirements

#### 3. **User Experience Impact**
- Users experience long loading times during data collection
- Onboarding flows are delayed significantly
- Dashboard data refresh takes too long
- Real-time analytics become impractical

#### 4. **Reliability Concerns**
- Inconsistent success rates across different AI providers
- Some requests never complete even after maximum polling attempts
- No webhook support (or unclear implementation) for async completion notifications

## What We Need: Ideal API Provider Requirements

### Must-Have Features

1. **Fast Response Times**
   - Synchronous responses: **< 30 seconds** (preferred)
   - Async completion: **< 2 minutes** from request to data availability
   - Minimal polling required (ideally webhook-based)

2. **High Reliability**
   - **> 95% success rate** for synchronous requests
   - Consistent uptime and availability
   - Graceful error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Support for Target AI Providers**
   - **Bing Copilot** (Microsoft AI search)
   - **Grok** (X/Twitter AI)
   - **Gemini** (Google AI)
   - Bonus: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity (if available)

4. **Structured Data Extraction**
   - Clean JSON responses with:
     - Response/answer text
     - Citations/sources (URLs)
     - Metadata (model version, timestamp, etc.)
   - Consistent schema across different AI providers

5. **Developer-Friendly**
   - Clear API documentation
   - Good error messages
   - Webhook support for async operations
   - Rate limiting transparency
   - SDK or easy integration (REST API)

6. **Scalability**
   - Handle concurrent requests (we run multiple collectors in parallel)
   - Reasonable rate limits (100+ requests per hour minimum)
   - Cost-effective pricing for high-volume usage

### Nice-to-Have Features

- Real-time streaming responses
- Built-in retry logic
- Response caching options
- Geographic targeting (region-specific results)
- Custom headers/user agents
- Proxy rotation (if needed for reliability)

## Research Questions

Please provide a comprehensive analysis addressing:

### 1. **Alternative API Providers**

Research and list **at least 5-10 alternative API providers** that offer LLM SERP/data collection services. For each provider, provide:

- **Provider Name & Website**
- **Supported AI Models** (specifically: Bing Copilot, Grok, Gemini)
- **API Type** (Synchronous, Asynchronous, Webhook-based, Hybrid)
- **Response Time** (average and maximum)
- **Success Rate** (if available from reviews/documentation)
- **Pricing Model** (per request, subscription, etc.)
- **Key Differentiators** (what makes them better than BrightData)

### 2. **Detailed Comparison Matrix**

Create a comparison table with the following criteria:

| Provider | Sync Response Time | Async Completion | Success Rate | Bing Copilot | Grok | Gemini | Pricing | Webhooks | Documentation Quality |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|------|--------|---------|----------|----------------------|
